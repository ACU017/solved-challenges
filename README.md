**Backstory:**

Many cultures have legends and stories about the devil. This project draws inspiration from a Colombian folktale, "El Violinista del Diablo" (The Devil's Violinist).

**The Legend:**

In this tale, a talented violinist named Antonio makes a pact with the devil to gain extraordinary musical skills. The devil agrees, but demands Antonio's soul in return. Antonio quickly becomes a renowned musician, captivating audiences with his virtuosity. However, as the time comes for the devil to claim his soul, Antonio pleads for one last chance.

The devil challenges Antonio to play a piece of music so beautiful that it would make even the devil weep. Antonio accepts, and with a heart filled with remorse and regret, plays a haunting melody that reflects his inner turmoil. The music is so powerful that it moves the devil to tears. Yet, the devil demands one final task: If Antonio can recite the Lord's Prayer in reverse order, he will grant him back his soul.

**Fear Not, The Solution:**

If you ever find yourself in Antonio's predicament, fear not! I've coded a solution for you. Head over to `diache.js`, run it with `node`, and the Lord's Prayer will appear phrase-by-phrase in the console.
